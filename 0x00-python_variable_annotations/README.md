# Python - Variable Annotations

Python is a dynamically-typed language. That means that variable types are dynamically set at run-time, upon assignment of a value to a variable.

#### In Python 3, type annotations do not change this. Python is still a dynamically-typed language. Type annotations serve the following purpose:

<ul>
<li>
Code documentation: thanks to them, a developer reading type-annotated code (his own or someone elseâ€™s) will know exactly what type each variables is supposed to be. This helps reduce bugs and exceptions and accelerate the development cycle.
</li>
<li>
Linting and validation: code editors and continuous integration (CI) pipelines can be configured to automatically validate type-annotated code at build-time and catch bugs before they make it to production.
</li>
</ul>

## Learning Objectives:

Here I will be learning and practicing on Python type annotations.

<ul>
<li>Type annotations in Python 3.</li>
<li>How you can use type annotations to specify function signatures and variable types.</li>
<li>Duck typing.</li>
<li>How to validate your code with mypy.</li>
</ul>
