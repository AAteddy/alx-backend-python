# Python - Async

Here in this part of the project I will be learning and practicing Python's Asynchronous IO (async IO) paradigm (model) that has implementations across a host of programming languages.

### Asynchronous IO (async IO):

a language-agnostic paradigm (model) that has implementations across a host of programming languages.

### async/await:

two new Python keywords that are used to define coroutines.

### asyncio:

the Python package that provides a foundation and API for running and managing coroutines.
